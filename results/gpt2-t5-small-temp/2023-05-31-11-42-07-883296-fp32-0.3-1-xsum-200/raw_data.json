Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr", "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack.

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you need to stick to", "Regina Hungerford, 56, denied striking a 17-year-old as he listened to music in her class at Merthyr Tydfil College. But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the", "She was speaking at an event on Thursday to remember four men who were shot dead by the SAS in her home village of Clonoe in 1992.

The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase.

The authority said it was spending about \u00a3100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought \u00a350m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said.

Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We are", "The launch of what was supposed to be its flagship model has turned into a fiasco for the world's largest smartphone maker.

But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene.

The false message said: \"Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.\" US markets were spooked by the tweet; the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 150 points as it was retweeted. On Tuesday evening, the FBI said it was investigating the incident. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters soon after the tweet was published that President Obama was fine, and financial markets quickly recovered the lost ground. AP said later: \"The @AP twitter account has been hacked. The tweet about an attack at the White House is false.\" The account was back online on Wednesday. The agency said the attack came after repeated attempts by hackers to steal the passwords of AP journalists, adding that it was working to correct", "John McCormack drove for a further 30 miles in the articulated lorry after hitting the vehicle on the A9.

The teenager, who was on his way to the conflict in the Middle East, was returned to the custody of his parents while investigations continued, said Mr Dutton.

Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said.

Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women", "As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in north Belfast.

The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen.

Growth in temporary staff demand was also at its highest in nearly a decade. However, recruiters said success was threatened by declining candidate availability as employers struggled to bring in the skills they need. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said whichever party formed a government after the general election on 8 June must safeguard access to workers the country needs from abroad, as well as invest in UK jobseekers. The jobs report found growth in permanent appointments continued for the third month running in April, with the fastest rate of expansion for 21 months.

It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP.

Mr Khan said the \"huge damage\" caused was \"a devastating thing to happen in the run-up to Christmas\". \"It is right that Thames Water have launched a full investigation, and residents and business must now get full compensation,\" he said.

The Crawick Artland Trust, which manages the site, has said it hopes to attract international visitors and boost business in Sanquhar, Kelloholm and Kirkconnel. The opening performance, which coincides with the Summer solstice, is called Oceanallover and it has been specially developed by artistic director Alex Rigg. He said: \"Through conversations with Charles Jencks and with the Duke of Buccleuch and the local community, it is clear to me that my job is to present something which is interesting to look at in itself but allows other people to see the potential of the site for future events.\" The performance is likely to raise questions, rather than answer them,", "The European Challenge Tour event will be part of a big week in the season with both the US PGA Championship and Women's British Open also taking place.

Caroline De Wolf, of the Antwerp World Diamond Centre, estimated the haul at $50m, saying: \"What we are talking about is obviously a gigantic sum.\" Earlier reports suggested the figure was even higher - with the Belgian state broadcaster reportedly putting it at 350m euros ($468m). AFP quoted an unnamed spokeswoman at the same Antwerp centre calling the robbery \"one of the biggest\" ever. She said that the diamonds were \"rough stones\" being transported from Antwerp to Zurich. Antwerp is the hub of the world diamond trade - about 150m euros' worth of stones move in and out of the city every day,", "The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling, was visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with 74 pensioner flats. Opponents insist the unlisted building is historically significant and an influx of elderly residents would put pressure on services in the village. The plans to be considered by the National Park Authority (NPA) are open for consultation until early January. Originally named, Glasshayes House, the mansion house on the edge of Lyndhurst was built in the early 19th Century as a private home for railway entrepreneur Charles Castleman. Along with Louis Stevenson, its notable historical guests included Lord Carnarvon of Highclere Castle. It later became the Grand Hotel, and then the Lyndhurst Park Hotel. PegasusLife plans to replace it with 74 \"age restricted ... high quality assisted living\" apartments for which it said there was \"a very high need\" for, along with 12 holiday lets.

It had hoped to increase the number of turbines between Kent and Essex to 341. The area is the winter home of about 6,500 red-throated divers - at least one third of the UK's population. London Array said it had formally requested The Crown Estate to terminate the agreement for lease for the phase two area and had cancelled the grid capacity that was reserved at the National Grid substation in Graveney, Kent. The wind farm, 10 miles north of Ramsgate, Kent, was given the green light in 2006 on condition that phase two, to add an extra 166 turbines, would only go ahead if the red-throated divers were protected. The RSPB was concerned the population of the birds in the outer Thames estuary could be displaced by the extension.

The NCA said that it had targeted users of software called Netspoof, a computer program that could direct huge volumes of internet traffic at websites and web servers in order to disable them.

The Department for Communities and Local Government is expected to announce the amendment to existing legislation on Monday. The changes - to be announced on Monday - will take effect from 16 May. Baroness Neville-Rolfe, minister for data protection, said the change will sent a \"clear message\" to rogue companies. \"Nuisance calls are incredibly intrusive and can cause significant harm to elderly and vulnerable members of society.\" The government was committed to tackling the problem, she said.

Last Monday, the government said it was willing to pause the introduction of the junior doctors' contract in England for five days to allow for talks. The BMA also agreed to defer any new threats of strikes for five days. The BBC's health editor Hugh Pym quoted a source as saying the government's preconditions were seen as a complicating factor but that there would be \"clarity about the next steps by the end of the day\". Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has previously indicated the government is willing to compromise. \"We've already made three significant compromises on Saturday pay but what we can't do is have a system where hospitals can't afford to roster enough doctors on a Saturday,\"", "The Crewe United players were charged with bringing the game into disrepute for bets placed on their Irish Cup tie against Warrenpoint Town on 4 February. Attempts were made to bet large sums on more than four goals being scored in the game, which Crewe lost 5-0. The players are suspended from all affiliated football until 31 May 2018. The IFA's Disciplinary Committee also imposed fines of \u00a3400 on each player, whose names have not been released. Prior to Wednesday night's hearing, all five players admitted to a breach of rules but claimed they had acted independently in placing bets. However, committee members \"were not convinced\" this was the case, according to an IFA statement. \"The committee wishes to express its concern at the negative impact betting on games can have on the game and urges all clubs, officials and players to familiarise themselves", "Hisense can make TV sets using the Sharp name thanks to a deal it signed with the company in 2015. Sharp said the TVs bearing its name broke US rules on electromagnetic emissions and that Hisense had made false claims about picture quality. Hisense said it \"categorically\" denied the claims made in Sharp's court papers and it would defend itself. As well as accusing the Hisense-made TV sets of breaking emission guidelines, Sharp said the devices also broke Federal Trade Commission rules on pictures sizes and did not meet wider industry standards covering device safety. Sharp's legal papers said its brand was at risk of being \"destroyed\" by the \"shoddily manufactured\" TV sets by the time the five-year deal ended. It wants Hisense to stop using the Sharp name. The legal action is believed to be linked to Sharp's efforts to rebuild itself after a long period of turmoil.

He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import cocaine into the UK in a \u00c2\u00a360m drugs plot between May and June 2013. Gerrard was jailed at Manchester Crown Court for 14 years. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Gerrard travelled to Rotterdam and met international drug traffickers with the plan of importing drugs from Latin America to Europe. The NCA appealed for help to find him following an October 2013 raid on a cafe in the Dutch city. Police believe Gerrard and others were using it as a front for a drugs smugglers' global operations centre.

The independence referendum led to an increase in numbers of people registering to vote. Expanded electoral rolls were used to identify those who had debts. The Scottish government said local authorities would be compensated. The poll tax, or community charge, was abolished more than 20 years ago in 1993 after only four years in operation in Scotland. The unpopular poll tax, which replaced the rates system, was introduced by the Conservative Thatcher government in Scotland in 1989 before the rest of the country, sparking protests on the streets.

The National Grid said the show would drive the biggest festive \"TV pickup\" - a sudden surge in electricity demand. The spike is largely down to viewers turning on lights and boiling their kettles straight after the programme. There is also a surge in the number of people going to the bathroom, which leads to a spike in the use of water companies' pumps, which draw electricity. The Great British Bake Off, the Strictly Christmas special and Call the Midwife are also expected to create high demand over the Christmas period. But TV surges create less demand now than they did 20 years ago because more people use catch-up services to watch TV and do not all see a programme live.

At a meeting of MPs, he was told the referendum could be \"lost\" unless the party made a more \"passionate\" case. His spokesman said he would be making a \"big\" speech on the EU \"in due course\". Speaking on a visit to Dagenham, Mr Corbyn said there were issues on which the EU should be challenged, but \"at the moment we're campaigning because we want this sense of unity across Europe\". Labour is campaigning \"on issues of social justice across Europe\" including the social chapter, which sets out EU policies on workers' rights, and the Working Time Directive governing the hours employees can work, he said. Mr Corbyn said he had held meetings with socialist parties across Europe on how they can support his campaign. During Labour's leadership race, Mr Corbyn refused to rule out campaigning to leave the EU, but", "The body, which represents 1,000 county officers, has placed adverts on buses and in local papers warning traditional policing could be abandoned. Wiltshire Police has lost 153 officers since 2010, the federation said. Chief Constable Mike Veale said he \"recognised the impact\" of cuts but it remained \"committed to local policing\". The federation's Cuts Have Consequences campaign claims the Wiltshire force \"already has the lowest number of officers per member of the public\" in the UK. It warns, with the workforce slashed by 16%, there are not enough response officers to \"rush to help\", communities are being left unsafe at night and drink-drivers are \"getting away with offences\". The federation says the force has had to slash \u00a317m from its budget and there are \"at least\" \u00a310m in cuts \"to come\". Federation chairman Mike White said: \"In reality, 80% of our policing budget is down to staff and staff wages. Yes, you can do things better and, yes, you can increase efficiencies but there comes a point", "A report into HMP Moorland said almost half of all prisoners claimed it was easy to get drugs compared to 28% at the last inspection. Inspectors said the availability of new psychoactive substances (NPS) was undermining recent progress. Prison bosses said more work needed to be done to tackle the problem. The report follows an unannounced inspection of the prison, near Hatfield Woodhouse, in February. It found the number of violent incidents, fights and assaults had increased since the last inspection in 2012 and levels were also higher than at similar prisons. More on this and other local stories in South Yorkshire Peter Clarke, Chief Inspector of Prisons, said: \"There are real opportunities at Moorland to make progress, but the issues of NPS... have such a negative impact on prisoners' experiences. \"In particular, there is a real opportunity to make progress in embracing the prison's new role as a resettlement prison, and in delivering treatment programmes for", "Last week, the High Court's rejected a bid by ministers to delay publication of the plan, which was prompted by high levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). This means the document should be published in the next week. Courts had given ministers until Monday 24 April to set out the draft guidelines. But on the Friday before the deadline, the government lodged an application to delay release until after the general election on 8 June. They argued that publication would fall foul of election \"purdah\" rules.

This is five days after the local elections, but long before the", "The phrase has been used close to 790,000 times on Twitter in that period. It's proven particularly popular with DJs, inspiring tweets, mash-ups, videos and confusion. But what is it and why has it been taking the dance music world by storm? Surprisingly, the answer lies in the bus horns of Indonesia. Young people in Indonesia, amused by the local buses' customised horns, have been waiting by the side of the road for vehicles to pass, encouraging bus drivers to toot their horn when they did so. Videos depicting this craze have gone viral in Indonesia. Some held signs to better attract the attention of the driver - signs which said 'Om Telolet Om'. 'Telolet' is a word representing the sound of the buses' horns, while 'om' is a term for an older male, like 'uncle' or 'sir' in English. So 'Om Telolet Om' roughly translates as 'Sir honk your horn sir'. OK, but what has that got to do with dance", "Keith McDonald was also placed on the sex offender's register for 10 years after being told he had \"abused his position as an employer\". At Selkirk Sheriff Court the 48-year-old was found guilty of committing the offences at the Ship Inn in Melrose. He was human resources manager at the pub where his wife was licensee. The court was told he repeatedly indecently assaulted one female employee between 2001 and 2011 by touching her breasts and buttocks which meant she tried to avoid contact with him. In 2007, McDonald indecently assaulted another female by touching her in a sexual nature. She immediately left her job. He was also found guilty of uttering sexual remarks to staff members over a 10-year period and on one occasion exposed himself in front of members of the public and two female members of staff. On July 14 last year McDonald sexually assaulted an 18-year-old female customer in the pub by touching her breasts and putting his hand", "Ryanair has cancelled more than 250 flights across Europe so far, including at least 26 flights in and out of Dublin and Shannon airports.

A lack of safe routes was cited by 38% as a barrier to cycling. Cycling Minister Robert Goodwill said his department's investment in cycling \"will help keep young cyclists safe\". The survey suggested that 44% of people in this age group never cycled and were therefore \"missing out on the benefits of cycling entirely\". However, Brake also found more people surveyed disagreed (59%) than agreed (41%) with the idea that current speed limits in their area are too fast for the safety of cyclists and pedestrians. Brake's deputy chief executive, Julie Townsend, said: \"That so many teenagers are being held back from walking and cycling by safety fears, in spite of its great benefits, is a shocking indictment of our road infrastructure.\" The government has proposed an amendment to the Infrastructure Bill currently", "More than 42,000 advance tickets have already been sold for the retrospective which opens to the public on Saturday.

It also said pilot Andy Hill was thrown clear of the aircraft during the later part of the crash on 22 August. The AAIB said it was not clear whether Mr Hill initiated his ejection. The 51-year-old pilot is currently in a serious but stable condition in hospital. The report says the Hawker Hunter's canopy was released at the initial impact. At this time fuel and fuel vapour was released and then ignited. The jet split into four parts and both Mr Hill and his seat were thrown clear of the cockpit. The report states: \"The investigation continues to determine if the pilot attempted to initiate ejection or if the canopy and pilot's seat were liberated as a result of impact damage to the cockpit.\" The AAIB's report also revealed there was no \"blackbox\" flight recorder on the vintage jet, however,", "His wife greeted him at their home in Toronto, Canada, and he was seen on the estate grounds by 14:00 (16:00 GMT). Black, 67, who controlled an empire including the Daily Telegraph in the UK, and US papers including the Chicago Sun-Times, left prison early on Friday. Earlier, Canada said he would be allowed to live there upon his release. Black was born in Canada but renounced his citizenship in 2001 to accept a peerage in Britain's House of Lords. He is a British citizen. The move to grant Black a one-year temporary residence permit stirred debate in Canada's House of Commons. Tom Mulcair, leader of the New Democratic Party, said Black had received special treatment. \"No-one else has ever been in that situation, of being still in jail, having his dossier marched around all the offices of the minister and getting his approval before even getting out of the slammer,\" Mr Mulcair said, according to CBC", "Fierce Beer began as a home-brewing sized business working out of premises in the city's Great Western Road and selling products to local bars. A limited company since April this year, it has set up a micro-brewery in Kirkhill Industrial Estate. Owners Dave Grant and David McHardy used redundancy pay-offs from their other jobs to help fund the business. Investors have also come on board to help finance the brewery, which is the only registered brewery in Aberdeen. Before the official launch this week, the brewery had been in operation for two months and in that time produced more than 20,000 litres of beer. With business development manager Louise Grant, the owners are producing eight beers which they are selling across the UK.

Previously, tour guide Trevor Dearlove denied failing to tell the passengers to wear seat belts and the bus driver was cleared of culpable murder. The three-day inquest at Loughborough Coroner's Court heard the group, who were studying for a degree in animal management and welfare, were on their way from Swaziland to visit a chimpanzee sanctuary. Students who survived the crash, told the hearing their guide did not tell them to wear seat belts and encouraged them to take in their surroundings.

The group was handcuffed and it was not immediately clear how they managed to free themselves to attack the guards. The two other suspects and three security officers were wounded. The suspects were accused of being part of a group known as GTA Gang, named after the violent game series Grand Theft Auto. The group of Central Asian nationals was suspected of killing 17 motorists in the Moscow area between 2012 and 2014. Cars were forced to stop on a main road and their drivers were killed for reasons as yet unknown; none of their possessions were stolen. In the court, one of the suspects attacked and tried to strangle an agent, as others attempted to seize the officers' weapons, Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement.

But the group has been responsible for a series of punishment-style shootings in the Derry area. In its statement released on Wednesday, RAAD said Mr Allen had been warned to \"cease his activities five to six months ago\" but had not done so. RAAD also issued a threat against six other unnamed individuals and warned they would face \"the ultimate sanction\".

The figures also reveal that SSE has almost all of its customers on the most expensive form of tariff. 91% of SSE customers are on standard variable tariffs, compared to just 9% at First Utility. The number of people stuck on standard tariffs is controversial, as most fixed-rate deals are cheaper. In the UK as a whole, 66% of households are on standard tariffs.

Ms Winning's letter to former Conservative MP Mr Reckless said board directors were \"extremely concerned and surprised\" to see the picture of him with Dr Phillip Barnes. Ms Winning said the photograph had been taken in September when Mr Reckless was the sitting MP for Rochester. Mr Reckless defected to UKIP on 27 September, triggering a by-election in which 13 candidates are standing.

During training, men appeared to show a preference for heavier-looking women. Lead researcher Dr Carlota Batres said men's preferences may adapt in tough environments so they mate with women best equipped to survive and reproduce. \"Our findings provide new evidence for the malleability of preferences depending on the environment,\" she said. \"We found that the weight preferences in prospective female partners changed in response to the harsher environment and then remained at the new level while the environment remained harsh. \"Such changes in preferences may be beneficial because they allow for increased opportunities to form partnerships with those who are better equipped to survive illness or uncertain food availability.\" Participants were asked to rate computer-generated female faces, which varied in apparent weight. For the control subjects - whose lives and environment did not change compared to baseline - there were no changes in their preferences.

Police in the western city of Bochum said the suspect had also boasted in a chat-room about murdering a woman. Although they could not confirm the second murder, investigators said the teenager had claimed the woman \"put up more of a fight than the child\" and weighed some 120kg (19 stone). The motive for his attack appeared to have been the woman's bank, computer and phone details. As the search for Marcel Hesse spread across the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia on Wednesday, a school was placed under lockdown for several hours some 30km (18 miles) away. Police in the town of Wetter said nothing suspicious was found. Children were told to play indoors at kindergartens in Herne, south of Bochum, where the boy died.

The case will go back to the organisation's appeal board on 24 May, when Best's conviction is likely to be overturned. However, the BHA insists it opposes other grounds for appeal and will effectively push for a retrial. \"Having received further details concerning the appeal, and having taken advice, we have decided not to contest the appeal on the grounds of apparent bias.

About 30 insurgents died in the attack, with Hamidullin the only survivor, while no American or Afghan soldiers were killed.
