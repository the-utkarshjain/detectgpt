Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been simultaneously negotiating with the Israeli parliament on reducing the number of Palestinian officials to take the time to investigate the move. \"The process once again proves that Israel is more committed to promoting peace for its illegal settler population than to abiding by the requirements for stability and a just peace,\" Hanan Ashrawi, an executive committee member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, quoted the Israeli government as saying by Reuters news agency. The administration of US President Donald Trump has yet to comment on the Israeli vote, which was unanimous. The new settlement will be used to house Jewish families evicted from the Palestinian outpost that was cleared last month after the Israeli Supreme Court ruled it had been built on private Palestinian land. Mr Netanyahu then told Israeli residents that a new area would be found for them.
